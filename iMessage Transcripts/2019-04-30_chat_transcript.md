| `2019-04-30 03:29:13` | Unknown | Turns out this was about Thursday not yesterday -- he is here then for dinner |
| `2019-04-30 03:40:23` | Jeffrey Epstein | as i thought. eric and all employees, wow trump trying to stop deutsch bank only a matter of time. |
| `2019-04-30 03:41:48` | Unknown | They won't be able to withhold the docs |
| `2019-04-30 03:42:31` | Jeffrey Epstein | of course not. but the dive is s0000 deep. I read the filing |
| `2019-04-30 03:42:47` | Unknown | How so |
| `2019-04-30 03:43:18` | Jeffrey Epstein | all employees. partners. members, for 10 years. |
| `2019-04-30 03:45:58` | Unknown | His strategy is drag this out for 15 months then it won't matter |
| `2019-04-30 03:47:03` | Jeffrey Epstein | yes -- of course |
| `2019-04-30 03:48:41` | Jeffrey Epstein | yes, it is a race, they have also asked for too much. so to fully understand it will take forever, unless weissleburg leads them through it and that would require fed immunity , unlikely to be authorized by barr. nystate, is the key , |
| `2019-04-30 03:49:19` | Jeffrey Epstein | again unless barr makes weiseblburg a material witness and keeps him away from ny . fun play |
| `2019-04-30 04:00:19` | Jeffrey Epstein | meeting in vienna went as i thought . their view was similar to mine. very . you can meet when you go to germany. |
| `2019-04-30 04:35:13` | Unknown | Similar as in 'nobody knows nothing' |
| `2019-04-30 04:36:02` | Jeffrey Epstein | case weak not well done can keep them for years |
| `2019-04-30 04:36:22` | Unknown | Oh on that yes |
| `2019-04-30 04:37:44` | Jeffrey Epstein | on another note if you like you can go to yemen and meet with heads . you have an invitation. |
| `2019-04-30 04:38:06` | Unknown | Would love it |
| `2019-04-30 04:38:12` | Jeffrey Epstein | have fun |
| `2019-04-30 04:38:28` | Jeffrey Epstein | you should if you decide of course coordinate with pompeo |
| `2019-04-30 04:38:51` | Jeffrey Epstein | but you will have access unlike others |
| `2019-04-30 04:38:53` | Unknown | Of course -- I'm sure it will be a resounding NO |
| `2019-04-30 04:39:19` | Jeffrey Epstein | I'm only F and B |
| `2019-04-30 04:39:46` | Unknown | KSA wants everybody to stay away-- closer inspection only leads to more doubts / head scratching |
| `2019-04-30 04:59:14` | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | Have you followed nick bostrom? |

| `2019-04-30 05:03:46` | Jeffrey Epstein | the christians i met with feel , the media portraying me as beyond redemption is deeply troubling and offensive |
| `2019-04-30 05:06:05` | Unknown | Yes yes yes of course -- but we must counter 'rapist who traffics in female children to be raped by worlds most powerful , richest men'--- that can't be redeemed - - that why we let them blow up the argument while showing the 12 you redeemed |
