| `2017-02-18 10:30:31` | Unknown | Also good |
| `2017-02-18 14:35:05` | Unknown | GENIUS IDEA Now to convince bill |
| `2017-02-18 14:36:02` | Unknown | Do you think there is a way to do this really well and also get something for BG? Like if we say do this and the admin will keep PEPFAR or something like that |
| `2017-02-18 14:36:25` | Jeffrey Epstein | yes and more |
| `2017-02-18 14:36:34` | Jeffrey Epstein | its a deal |
| `2017-02-18 14:36:39` | Jeffrey Epstein | thats what he likes |
| `2017-02-18 14:37:46` | Jeffrey Epstein | he said malaria and polio not an american problem. climate change and eboloa not a american problem nor is clean water or genital mutilation. he thinks bill should stop trying to scare people .ike chicken little. |
| `2017-02-18 14:40:26` | Unknown | PEPFAR is HIV AIDS |
| `2017-02-18 14:40:36` | Jeffrey Epstein | aids is partially an american problem. as is drug abuse. |
| `2017-02-18 14:40:51` | Unknown | OK let's keep thinking BG likes deals too |
| `2017-02-18 14:41:13` | Unknown | PEPFAR was a george bush/republican thing |
| `2017-02-18 14:41:35` | Unknown | It's the only one of the international health things the republicans all seem to support |
| `2017-02-18 14:41:43` | Unknown | Trump even kept the obama person running it |
| `2017-02-18 14:42:16` | Unknown | If he could be convinced to keep PEPFAR as is in exchange for cyber i think we would all win |
| `2017-02-18 14:44:41` | Jeffrey Epstein | bill needs to focus on american problems first and foremost , if he wants deals. he can also portray certain worldwide iniativies as buying american drugs etc. IT MUST have an american component. donald says it is childish to count the lives at risk in africa and make believe you are doing something for america. or pakistan afhhntan, etc. he points to 8500 killed in chicago vs 2500 killed in afganistan over the past 10 years. |
| `2017-02-18 14:45:00` | Unknown | I understand |
| `2017-02-18 14:45:23` | Unknown | Bills advisory team at fndn all pushing in other direction |
| `2017-02-18 14:45:37` | Unknown | At c3 I can try to reposition Just until I get thrown out |
| `2017-02-18 14:46:01` | Unknown | Wish there was a way for him to have a real Conversation |
| `2017-02-18 14:46:10` | Jeffrey Epstein | I sent bill a note to suggest he talk to lauder. donald also thinks bill wants not to help america first , he should use his own money, and even that is wrong as it was made here. just transmitting |
| `2017-02-18 14:47:19` | Unknown | I think trump should enforce tax laws and now allow gates fndn (American) to spend money overseas tax free |
| `2017-02-18 14:48:10` | Jeffrey Epstein | number of lives saved per dollar amount is not in donalds mind, it must be american lives saved, and yes, good idea on tax |
| `2017-02-18 14:48:31` | Unknown | Right now there are funny loopholes we figured out how to exploit |
| `2017-02-18 14:48:50` | Unknown | Like exercising expenditure responsibility on foreign grants so we could still count as charitable |
| `2017-02-18 14:49:15` | Unknown | Or giving to UN or international orgs but earmarking for polio etc when not a single dollar ever benefitted USA |
| `2017-02-18 14:49:28` | Unknown | I know where all those loopholes are bc I helped find them |
| `2017-02-18 14:49:29` | Jeffrey Epstein | understood I am good at that , however bill should be careful very careful as donald could make an example of him using american dollars to help other than america which really needs it. careful |
| `2017-02-18 14:50:22` | Unknown | Understood |
| `2017-02-18 14:50:57` | Unknown | Let's make a deal for a few months To push cyber and then get out and help trump make examples and do better stuff |
| `2017-02-18 14:51:45` | Unknown | BG has already made too many commitments and he did it based on his foundation but counting on leveraging and influencing us Gov't |
| `2017-02-18 14:52:09` | Unknown | If the tax laws are enforced and he is forced to pay on his own and has less, lord knows how he will react |
| `2017-02-18 14:52:32` | Unknown | But - cyber is a "let's do now" thing March 15 I see BG next Friday |
| `2017-02-18 14:52:54` | Jeffrey Epstein | cyber is great |
| `2017-02-18 14:53:50` | Unknown | Have to act quickly |
| `2017-02-18 14:54:03` | Jeffrey Epstein | yup |
| `2017-02-18 14:54:40` | Jeffrey Epstein | you might want to attend kruase conference in tucson on 26th . i can organize |
| `2017-02-18 14:54:54` | Unknown | Can only do after march 15 |
| `2017-02-18 14:55:06` | + | But yes after that will do 100% |
| `2017-02-18 15:22:29` | Unknown | Issue really is about how easy it is For fndns to spend tax dollars of Americans. Like how generous would they be if they had to spend their own money? Also - 1. All laws that apply to us foreign policy should be applied to charitable orgs spending us tax dollars. So the global gag rule should apply Across philanthropic dollars too. If ppl want to spend Personal money they can just Not charitable. This should be done immediately. 2. Should not be allowed to grant to foreign Gov't w Charitable dollars. That's basically lobbying or a bribe - charitable money shouldn't be allowed. Relates also to #1 above. 3. If charities want to spend charity dollars outside us should be required To go through USAid so it isn't being sneaky and on other agendas. 4. USAID should have a big charity division that does only this for Science and tech. |
| `2017-02-18 15:22:42` | Unknown | Dont do this till we get cyber last |
| `2017-02-18 15:23:58` | Unknown | This would bring billions back To USA for social issues |
| `2017-02-18 15:24:03` | Unknown | Immediately |
