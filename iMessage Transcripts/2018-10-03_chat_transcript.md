| `2018-10-03 02:56:05` | Jeffrey Epstein | Nyt-By age 3, Mr. Trump was earning $200,000 a year in today's dollars from his father's empire. / this is UNFAIR- what are " todays dollars? The article was written by financial illiterates |
| `2018-10-03 03:06:16` | Jeffrey Epstein | The times did exactly the same as they accuse Donald. Wild exaggeration |
| `2018-10-03 03:22:15` | Jeffrey Epstein | They never say how they calculated these numbers. They ignore taxes paid along the way. etc |
| `2018-10-03 03:22:29` | Jeffrey Epstein | Hannity should rip the NYT |
| `2018-10-03 03:33:53` | Unknown | How : they are not that sophisticated |
| `2018-10-03 03:34:35` | Jeffrey Epstein | Pose questions. |
| `2018-10-03 03:39:14` | Unknown | Isn't it true |
| `2018-10-03 03:50:47` | Jeffrey Epstein | What are " todays dollars: The IRS reviewed the issues . And agreed with trump. " if my grandfather would have bought one hundred dollar in treasury bills. the article to be accurate would have said when Donald was 3 years old he received 14k per year. And it doesn't say whether taxes were paid on that |
| `2018-10-03 03:51:45` | Jeffrey Epstein | Instead it says 200k in todays dollars and when he was 8 he had a million |
| `2018-10-03 04:06:23` | Jeffrey Epstein | Instead had Fred put 2k dollar in treassuries it would be worth 1 m today . All silly |
