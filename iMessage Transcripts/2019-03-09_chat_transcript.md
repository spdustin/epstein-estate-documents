[61 In 2001, his office launched a Martin Act investigation against Merrill Lynch for suspected fraud. [61 When the investigation was made public, Merrill's market value dropped $5 billion in one week. [61 Ultimately, Merill settled, agreeing to pay a $100 million fine and change the way its analysts are paid to head off possible criminal charges that it misled investors with tainted stock research. |

Misdemeanors are punishable by a fine of up to $500 or imprisonment of up to one year, or both. [21 Felonies carry a penalty of up to four years of imprisonment. [21 Judicial Interpretation |
