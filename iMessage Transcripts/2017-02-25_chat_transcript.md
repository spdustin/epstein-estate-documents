| `2017-03-03 08:24:08` | Jeffrey Epstein | not sure why you don't just appease larry. as he is the bottleneck, it is silly. you continue to be jerks around |
| `2017-03-03 08:24:31` | Jeffrey Epstein | what you put on paper is ONLY to get in, stop wasting time. |

| `2017-03-04 15:32:51` | Jeffrey Epstein | Funding NIH grants ? |
| `2017-03-04 15:36:40` | Unknown | That is built around peer review and the incumbent networks of power in each field |
| `2017-03-04 15:37:12` | Unknown | That's also why smart ppl and ideas are now chasing VC and private equity instead of grants |
| `2017-03-04 15:39:12` | Unknown | Have you seen arianna Huffington's new effort? Media driven platform For health and wellness - money from jack Ma and Jeff Bezos w connections into Amazon and Alibaba She wants to talk to me Monday and I will be in NYC Might be another path to surgeon general in the sense of being the consumer facing health and wellness guru - like a more evolved dr oz or Oprah but linked to products Interesting concept |
| `2017-03-04 15:41:56` | Unknown | She's got reputation and money and the whole thing dedicated to health and wellness / being on her leadership team and the head doc is cool - jack says I could do Alibaba pop up shops on anything health wellness and sell a zillion products of whatever kind and also as a doc present the evidence. Bezos could do something similar on Amazon. Both are outside bill space but he likes them Also - is profitable and builds credibility towards Americas doctor / Presenting best evidence on products and also education on certain topics (like headaches or sleep or obesity or whatever) Of course I'm still going to work w bill a few months. But maybe start w her right after OR SOONER |
| `2017-03-04 15:42:06` | Unknown | More Monday afternoon |

| `2017-03-04 16:17:47` | Unknown | Well bill says he has zero interest in doing anything helpful on health or tech for US until trump stands up on international development and aid |
| `2017-03-04 16:18:27` | Unknown | Will keep pushing but he says his #1 priority is ODA (overseas development aid) |
| `2017-03-04 16:19:40` | Unknown | I told him the tech play is one that he can pull off where everyone wins and I can help get that started and he says that his "policy package" will depend on what trump does for him .... |
| `2017-03-04 16:21:17` | Unknown | What did you learn from medical consortium ??? Call me! |

| `2017-03-04 16:43:21` | Jeffrey Epstein | They think everyone should have med records in their phone . Defense dept records different system than VA. Hate intl aid vs US NEEDS . NIH , techno transfer goofy, Grant s too difficult. Drugs too addicting etc |
| `2017-03-04 16:45:42` | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | Med records should be in cloud w homomorphic encryption ability To get what is needed without putting data at risk but yes ppl should own their own medical records |

| `2017-03-15 07:31:47` | Jeffrey Epstein | unlikely |
| `2017-03-15 07:33:09` | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | Any news / anything interesting BG in D.C. 20/21 |
| `2017-03-15 07:33:40` | Jeffrey Epstein | he should meet with torn barrack, if he wants traction |
| `2017-03-15 07:34:17` | Jeffrey Epstein | what happened to the jack ma deal |
| `2017-03-15 07:35:39` | Unknown | I have told him that. He believes his team are better connected and that Jared and ivanka are his interlocutors |
| `2017-03-15 07:38:13` | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | Jack wants me to help arianna huffington - he invested in her company thrive (so did Bezos) Her company does half corporate wellness and half ecommerce but she hasn't built out ecommerce Jack believes there is big opportunity for what he calls a "category" in the wellbeing ecommerce space. He says I have tech skills and doctor skills and wellness sense to help her build that part of the business - basically a JV w Alibaba. Bezos is hoping for the same thing |
| `2017-03-15 07:38:42` | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | Alibaba and Amazon are biggest marketplaces and super interesting opportunity both commercially and intellectually |
| `2017-03-15 07:38:45` | Jeffrey Epstein | not my thing , i can add nothing |

| `2017-03-15 07:39:45` | Unknown | Chief Medical Officer |
| `2017-03-15 07:40:03` | Unknown | Jack says too hard to build these innovations from within Alibaba and has to come from JV |
| `2017-03-15 07:40:43` | Unknown | BG world is so backwards. Makes me sad. Wish there was a better space but for now will keep working on the bgc3 and next steps. |
| `2017-03-15 07:42:11` | Unknown | Thanks for your support always |
| `2017-03-15 07:43:20` | Unknown | Should I try to join Boris over time? He's venturing into brain space |
| `2017-03-15 07:43:25` | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | Pretty deeply |
| `2017-03-15 07:43:43` | Unknown | Not sure he wants more ppl or thinks I add value |
