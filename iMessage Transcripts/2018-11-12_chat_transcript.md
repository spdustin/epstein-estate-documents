| `2018-11-18 09:37:15` | Unknown | Just landed in Brussels, we have EU Foreign ministers meeting here tomorrow |
| `2018-11-18 10:00:53` | Jeffrey Epstein | Understood |
| `2018-11-19 02:13:19` | Unknown | As of today... |
| `2018-11-19 02:38:30` | Unknown | 0y, indeed |
| `2018-11-19 11:12:03` | Unknown | Mid January |
| `2018-11-19 11:12:45` | Unknown | Yes. Something will happen by then. |
| `2018-11-20 04:42:43` | Unknown | I said today that if Slovakia withdraws from Migration compact I will consider resignation. It's a breaking news all over the media. And it might actually happen. I might have to do it to protect my professional and personal integrity. |
| `2018-11-20 04:49:57` | Jeffrey Epstein | The prime minister is still on your side? |
| `2018-11-20 04:50:16` | Jeffrey Epstein | do I understand correctly that it is you vs parliament? |
| `2018-11-20 04:51:10` | Unknown | Yes, the PM is with me. But the former PM and party chairman is pushing for withdrawal |
| `2018-11-20 04:51:47` | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | Parliament can only recommend to the government. |
| `2018-11-20 04:52:23` | Unknown | But I will totally lose credibility if Slovakia withdraws and I stay silent |
| `2018-11-20 04:57:59` | Jeffrey Epstein | Agreed |
| `2018-11-20 04:58:59` | Jeffrey Epstein | More divisiveness. I guess better opportunity to be seen to unify? |
| `2018-11-20 05:00:18` | Unknown | Maybe. And maybe another signal that internal politics is for me, at least not at this stage |
| `2018-11-20 05:01:00` | Jeffrey Epstein | It seems people are trying to make the argument that strength is in opposition to humanity.. ? I assume you meant that internal is NOT for you. . ( that's how wars start ) |
| `2018-11-20 05:01:50` | Unknown | Yes, you are right:) Not for me |
| `2018-11-20 05:24:07` | Unknown | I called back, you have voicemail |
| `2018-11-20 05:24:14` | Unknown | Feel free to call |
| `2018-11-20 05:51:22` | Jeffrey Epstein | tried |
| `2018-11-22 04:14:53` | Jeffrey Epstein | Appears like a fun committee meeting. Don't let them get you to be emotional. Breathe.! Think judicial demeanor. |
| `2018-11-22 04:16:45` | Jeffrey Epstein | If you decide to resign. Lets make the resignation powerful. |
| `2018-11-22 04:18:11` | Unknown | You are right. I stay cool, only in reaction to MPs stupid statements I I got a bit emotional. But not too much. |
| `2018-11-22 04:18:33` | Unknown | Thanks, if going then going in style:) |
| `2018-11-22 04:19:40` | Unknown | But in general I'm surprisingly relaxed. I feel I'm doing the right thing. And there is a powerful positive reaction from people. |
| `2018-11-22 04:26:26` | Jeffrey Epstein | Im not surprised. , I think your position is just. It is the explanation of it that needs tailoring. Ie Not on the table youre on the menu, is too flippant You know your country. It wants to appear strong. Hiding from attending engenders the opposite I think you can make a great case that attending strengthens the country s hand. Hiding , running away from the issue , shows weakness and brings more trouble. . |
| `2018-11-22 04:28:04` | Unknown | Yes, you are right. I will stress that more. |
| `2018-11-22 04:32:51` | Jeffrey Epstein | " Slovaks don't run and hide . We stand tall and say ...... . Or nyet. Or Slovakia must decide what is good for Slovakia . Fun |
| `2018-11-22 04:34:50` | Unknown | Fun:) |
| `2018-11-22 04:35:22` | Unknown | I said many of these things yesterday in the Committee |
| `2018-11-22 04:35:36` | Jeffrey Epstein | I think this issue helps frame your own decision making. Its not do you want to be president and what that means. , more and more it means. Can I stand to be around these small minded people |
| `2018-11-22 04:36:44` | Unknown | Yes, exactly |
| `2018-11-22 13:29:40` | Jeffrey Epstein | "I think Europe needs to get a handle on migration because that is what lit the flame," Clinton said regarding the rise of rightwing populists like Hungary's |
| `2018-11-22 13:33:01` | Unknown | He's absolutely right |
| `2018-11-22 13:33:13` | Jeffrey Epstein | She |
| `2018-11-22 13:34:01` | Unknown | Oh, OK. But she's still right:))) |
| `2018-11-26 03:08:51` | Jeffrey Epstein | Progress? |
| `2018-11-26 03:38:31` | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | Both President and the Prime Minister are working on a deal. They don't want to lose me. Parliament is still stubborn. I said my read line is to go to Marrakech and not to reject the Migration compact in its entirety. The vote on the parliamentary resolution was postponed until next week. I'm in Turkey today, was just received by Erdogan for a very long, private and friendly meeting. Flying to Berlin from here. |
| `2018-11-26 10:05:59` | Jeffrey Epstein | Did he give you an Apple Watch to record your future conversations |
| `2018-11-26 10:06:35` | Unknown | No, he didn't:) |
| `2018-11-26 10:07:07` | Unknown | But he spoke at length about it |
| `2018-11-26 10:07:27` | Unknown | About the case, not the watch:) |
| `2018-11-26 10:07:57` | Jeffrey Epstein | He talks a lot doesn't he? |
| `2018-11-26 10:08:08` | Unknown | He will continue raising it in various international fora |
| `2018-11-26 10:08:12` | Unknown | He does |
| `2018-11-26 10:08:48` | Unknown | And he likes me. The Foreign minister was our Interpreter |
| `2018-11-29 14:24:53` | Unknown | Are you OK? |
