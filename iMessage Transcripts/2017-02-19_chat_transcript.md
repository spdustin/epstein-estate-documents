| `2017-02-21 08:27:01` | Jeffrey Epstein | all good |
| `2017-02-21 11:48:38` | Unknown | Seems like a lot of thinking already underway. Still feels a little abstract for the average American. Need to make this real to average person and also to congress |
| `2017-02-21 11:49:06` | Jeffrey Epstein | just you the term PRIVACY of your health info. |
| `2017-02-21 11:50:06` | Jeffrey Epstein | only you have the key. |
| `2017-02-21 11:50:07` | Unknown | Can we do anything from bills office on that? |
| `2017-02-21 11:50:18` | Unknown | I like that A LOT |
| `2017-02-21 11:50:59` | Unknown | do you think trump will Come down hard on gates / taxes soon or can he wait till I'm done there?!? |
| `2017-02-21 11:51:27` | Jeffrey Epstein | yes , encryption. , signal processing. . using the best methods to keep your health info secret. and at the same time helping the country cure disease. |

| `2017-02-21 11:55:17` | Unknown | Role: Health and medical technologies Term: 6 months from April 1 Areas of |
| `2017-02-21 12:24:45` | Unknown | I see bill Friday Really want to wait and talk to him before sending Larry terms Of reference but he is insisting I send sooner |
| `2017-02-21 13:42:17` | Jeffrey Epstein | Health security |
| `2017-02-21 13:48:28` | Unknown | Some Overlap w fndn but I can try |
| `2017-02-21 14:08:06` | Jeffrey Epstein | Yes |
| `2017-02-21 20:42:21` | Unknown | Bill says health security works ok but should be tech or digital so everyone knows I'm not just doing policy - he says "title needs teeth" |
| `2017-02-22 01:27:10` | Jeffrey Epstein | Crypto health data |
| `2017-02-22 01:27:57` | Jeffrey Epstein | Health data ciphers |
| `2017-02-22 01:28:36` | Jeffrey Epstein | Bitcoin health |
| `2017-02-22 04:38:08` | Unknown | Cryptohealth is funny. Health security I think best though |
| `2017-02-22 08:22:36` | Unknown | Well - Larry called / says he needs to see a "detailed scope, focus and deliverables" before he can sign off and letting me know he runs the office not bg said no problem! |
| `2017-02-22 08:24:34` | Unknown | My guess is that he will hold me To every single word so I need to be strategic and also somewhat flexible since it's hard to know how things will work If you have some time maybe think of the deliverables that would be useful and something to be proud of - I will work on all the rest since he wants me to circle back w all the MSFT and foundation leaders too |
| `2017-02-22 08:24:54` | Unknown | Why does bg get kicked around like this? So silly |
| `2017-02-22 08:25:33` | Jeffrey Epstein | using the zero knowledge proof concept to keep totally private and secure the personal health info of the person while the same time being able to use the underlying date to create a usable data base. |
| `2017-02-22 08:26:57` | Jeffrey Epstein | either a version of block chain, encryption or personal cloud, protecting the rights of the people at risk, deliverable, working with cyber security experts to craft a system designed for both security but access to digitally redacted prersonal info. |
| `2017-02-22 08:27:29` | Jeffrey Epstein | see working with the cyber security people as well as hippo. |
| `2017-02-22 08:28:07` | Jeffrey Epstein | possibly the next version of a wearable. a sensor that has protected input based on personal history etc. |
| `2017-02-22 08:29:09` | Unknown | Can I do this in 6 months? |
| `2017-02-22 08:29:26` | Unknown | It's more Msft Than anything else |
| `2017-02-22 08:30:15` | Jeffrey Epstein | yes, its also foundation re sensitive info on one hand and relevant data base creation and manipulation on the other |
| `2017-02-22 08:31:12` | Unknown | More Questions: 1. How can I be public about being the one that is doing this (surgeon general) and not just handing this off to msft? Publishing? 2. Have you heard of aardhar the Indian biometric made by Nandan nilekani? Bill loves. Could this be a new type of social security number and used for all types of identity with health as a single use case? |
| `2017-02-22 08:32:15` | Jeffrey Epstein | it has to be run by a doctor and not a computer scientist\\ |
| `2017-02-22 08:32:18` | Unknown | If i do something great I want ppl to Know I'm involved. It's been hard being the one to do stuff and others get credit. |
