| `2018-09-09 03:52:13` | Jeffrey Epstein | Gyorgy Schwartz. real name of George Soros . Was careful not to register under fara. NGOs were carefully structured. - My reading is that you can form a media co. and make that the umbrella exemption |
| `2018-09-09 03:52:51` | Unknown | On it |
| `2018-09-09 03:53:56` | Jeffrey Epstein | The media co. has lots of advantages. Source privilege etc |

| `2018-09-09 11:10:42` | Jeffrey Epstein | Without committing perjury |
| `2018-09-09 11:12:42` | Jeffrey Epstein | And you would have to have prepared a serious defense strategy . Powerful legal advice etc . |
| `2018-09-09 11:23:06` | Jeffrey Epstein | Not to put too much emphasis. But they say they relied on the trusted intermediary. ? you wouldn't have to do that if you met the official? It says the author not the person ? And testimony . 0 |
| `2018-09-09 11:36:27` | Unknown | ??? |

| `2018-09-12 09:19:56` | Jeffrey Epstein | They also were adamant and agreed with you , that China for the very first time is following an imperialistic strategy, well thought through. Covered in nice " silk" . And lamented the moment that Total , the French oil co , was forced to leave Iran . China was there within the week . |

| `2018-09-14 03:43:13` | Unknown | We heard It's because manafort AND Cohen are taking up there time |
| `2018-09-14 03:43:19` | Jeffrey Epstein | Im in New York lots to discuss |
| `2018-09-14 03:43:39` | Jeffrey Epstein | is donald doing your spelling |
| `2018-09-14 03:43:43` | Unknown | Yes-- this afternoon ? |
| `2018-09-14 03:43:54` | Jeffrey Epstein | perfect |
| `2018-09-14 03:44:04` | Unknown | Very stable speller |
| `2018-09-14 04:00:34` | Jeffrey Epstein | look at china moving into venezuela. brilliant move |
| `2018-09-14 04:00:48` | Unknown | Yes |
| `2018-09-14 04:01:22` | Unknown | What would be the three major points you make to the economist event tomorrow ??? |
| `2018-09-14 04:02:02` | Jeffrey Epstein | they get oil , geographic choke point, spread down to argentina and establlsh. foothold . |
| `2018-09-14 04:03:31` | Jeffrey Epstein | let me think, 1 . I would think that the world got to vote on the trump presidency. and it votes by buying dollars . look at lira. venezuela brazil. india. europe. the world voted and the Us is way ahead. all the worry about tariffs, trade etc are reflected in the strength of the dollar. |
| `2018-09-14 04:05:29` | Jeffrey Epstein | 2. all the talk about lower tax revenues misses the point . it is about the country's cash flow not internally generated revenue . billions of dollars came back from europe. , and into our system it is not reflected in tax revenue numbers. ex , if apple brings back 100 billion dollars and invests it , it does not show in treasury tax revenue figure |
| `2018-09-14 04:06:33` | Unknown | Brilliant brilliant brilliant -- help me develop that argument on 10th anniversary of Lehman |
| `2018-09-14 04:15:28` | Jeffrey Epstein | in addition , wage rise AFTER unemployment goes down. NOT before. ! trump first put the most disadvantaged the UNEMPLOYED first. . and with great success. can you imagine the attacks if wages went up , but the blacks and hispanics were still without work. He needs to be given TIME . the first play has worked. he believes in a winning game strategy, you can't judge it because he hasn't scored a touchdown from way in his own backfield. ( ball given to him by obama on his own 10 yard line ) he has moved the ball way up the field. and the dems can see the touchdown coming. yes there have been some fumbles along the way, no question. and some have been taken off the field. but the horror and the dems faces is they see the team has progressed in spite of all the yellow flags and cries of foul. There ( sic ) defense is maxine waters and nancy pelosi ) donalds offense is pompeo mattis and kelly. they don't have to like the quarterback they just have to win, |
| `2018-09-14 04:18:23` | Jeffrey Epstein | Lehman was caused by pelosi. because she is a true dope. she wanted a change in accounting , because she conflated her checking account with that of a govt. . a longer story . - i will go through the prime trading partners and their currency decline since you guys took office. . makes for quite a chart |
| `2018-09-14 04:19:50` | Unknown | Can u meet later today? |
| `2018-09-14 04:20:10` | Jeffrey Epstein | at your convenience . yes |
| `2018-09-14 04:22:15` | Unknown | Late around 6??? |
| `2018-09-14 04:26:20` | Jeffrey Epstein | done see you then\\ |
| `2018-09-14 04:42:38` | Jeffrey Epstein | the football analogy , helps with the anonymous op ed. imagine if a team member thought they would work against tom brady strategy. fans would go crazy. and like a football team they call each other dumbfuck in the locker room but pull together on the field |
| `2018-09-14 04:44:33` | Jeffrey Epstein | however ill stick to economic advice, you might also point out that saudi sovereign wealth fund needed to borrow money. !!. they mistakenly and childishly think that the fact that they can borrow 10 billion dollars at not a very good rate showed strength. but in fact, like their fade in the tesla mess , illustrates they have no cash. I think masa is japanese's for madoff |
| `2018-09-14 05:00:46` | Jeffrey Epstein | Saudi Arabia set to enter the Guinness Book of Records with the display of the largest number of fireworks and unfurling of the largest national flag to mark the celebrations of the 88thNational Day. this is the mentality of other countries |
| `2018-09-14 05:26:12` | Jeffrey Epstein | the other two areas. 1. dems scream trump deregulating where mnuchin has instituted the stricter KYC rules in history. The U S leads. class americans would put their money in Switzerland today where the banks charge YOU . 75 basis points to keep it there. so many bad actors. 2, crypto needs to be thought of similar to the internet. intl agreements . coordinated understandings . otherwise it is a ponzi scheme outside of the law how many working |
