| `2017-03-29 03:58:23` | Jeffrey Epstein | you were greatly missed. we would both have loved to have you there. . re trip I m told it is a part of Israel strategy. should know more after i return from paris.-fyi Im told that buy India in reality is limited to a certain category of things . i.e. many can only be truly made in america. ( with its inherent risks for back doors. ) IT- yes , jet engines no. however , very enthusiastic over having private biz involved as it is seen to be much less corrupt than govt; ( please keep in mind , my expertise is money not politics . so I merely transmit things to you that I'm sure you understand though I might not ) |
| `2017-03-29 04:12:41` | Jeffrey Epstein | yes I fully understood . what i am told is that discussions re Israel strategy were dominating modi dates. however lots and lots of internal conflicts taking priority. |
