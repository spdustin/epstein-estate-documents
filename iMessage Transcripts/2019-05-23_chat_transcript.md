| `2019-05-29 04:19:06` | Jeffrey Epstein | Standby |
| `2019-05-29 07:56:23` | Jeffrey Epstein | I read the whole book, its mainly you and your funny descriptions of people. Lol a couple of times. Nothing that interesting. Again points out how most think trump is awful insane .etc. |
| `2019-05-29 08:23:11` | Unknown | How bad am I going to get lit up ??? |
| `2019-05-29 08:25:31` | Jeffrey Epstein | Probably like the last time. Though in the epilogue he thanks you for being a source that stood by his comments in the first book |

Pence and the mother Manipulating meadows. Bossie behind the scenes. , trump going after jr. I would say most of the book is you and your views |
| `2019-05-29 08:57:28` | Jeffrey Epstein | With mueller saying today that he couldn't say trump didn't commit crimes. And that to charge him would be unfair as he couldn't defend himself but they preserved evidence for when he could , probably will take the focus off of you and your funny comments, |
| `2019-05-29 10:11:52` | Unknown | Did mueller just start an impeachment process |
| `2019-05-29 10:14:22` | Jeffrey Epstein | I don't believe so , but I can tell you that had he been referring to me or you , and said I preserved the evidence so that if a time comes when you can defend yourself. It could be used. Im not sure id get a good night sleep |
