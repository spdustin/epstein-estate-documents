| `2018-08-24 08:06:33` | Jeffrey Epstein | he knows all , |
| `2018-08-24 08:08:03` | Unknown | The establishment hates trump |

| `2018-08-24 14:55:50` | Unknown | Jeff I apologize for tonight I'm having a hard time getting down there with the traffic. I'm up in northern Connecticut trying to unload my son Dorm |

| `2018-08-24 14:57:14` | Unknown | OK terrific. I didn't realize he had to give me back there for his lacrosse practice this afternoon |
| `2018-08-24 19:07:01` | Jeffrey Epstein | I assume you are still close to invanka . if so , there are a few of his heavy hitter friends that would like to help ( me not included of course ). I think a war council. schwartzman wynn, rudy, lorber lefrak.you barrack , should be called in to give suggestions . weissleburg , cohen pecker all together doesn't bode well. . I didn't add bannon as i know ivanka hates him. though as you said about bedfellows . he would be a good addition if it wasn't for his baggage . |
| `2018-08-24 19:15:13` | Jeffrey Epstein | and not sure he will actually follow any advice but you could try . |
