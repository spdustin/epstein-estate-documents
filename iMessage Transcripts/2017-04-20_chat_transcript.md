| `2017-04-20 06:29:02` | Unknown | Bill Helman has some ideas on how to create a business around this and to monetize the concepts / plant to human translational research and don't worry he's incredibly discrete. And discreet. Also Geoff Ling the former head of DARPA and total genius is also my good friend and very supportive - didn't give a ton of detail but he says he will do whatever or even help run, advise, etc. he knows how to make science fiction science fact. |

| `2017-04-20 06:39:33` | Unknown | So when I went to interview at darpa the woman who was the head (arathi something can't remember last name) told geoff she couldn't hire someone so gorgeous because it would distract the men trying to focus on work |
| `2017-04-20 06:40:41` | Jeffrey Epstein | i sent bill a note after talking to wash, he is causing them to rethink the charitable deduction for overseas programs. donald is NOT pragmatic. that takes thinking ability, . he is setting himself up as part of yesterdays establishment and their perceived mistakes. |
| `2017-04-20 06:40:44` | Unknown | And it would shift the focus of their thinking from science to sex. She also told that to Dan wattendorf (almost same Exact words ). Was a gross feeling to be spoken of like that by another woman. |

| `2017-04-20 06:42:47` | Jeffrey Epstein | its ok, he will believe it when it happens , and then hear I told you so. trump tells everyone the exact same thing. exact |
| `2017-04-20 06:43:21` | Unknown | Bill says 1. Trump will never get the budget cuts through. He claims he's spoken to senators and that they will fight and that the White House can't unilaterally do a budget like that. 2. He says trump can't unilaterally change the tax code. |
| `2017-04-20 06:43:55` | Unknown | 3. He says trump will be in power 3.5 more years or less and that his foundation has a 30 year life |
