| `2018-06-17 08:10:10` | Jeffrey Epstein | One of my favorites. : Replying to @ThisWeekABC @jonkarl Jon Karl was eaten alive by Bannon. Don't have guests on like Bannon if you don't have an interviewer who can match wits. Bannon is an awful man - a dishonest man with a reactionary, right-wing agenda. He needs to be interviewed by someone who can challenge him effectively. |
