| `2017-06-30 04:39:58` | Unknown | Thank you for dinner last night. |
| `2017-06-30 05:23:23` | Jeffrey Epstein | Why are you being nice? |
| `2017-06-30 05:48:02` | Unknown | I guess because I'm in desperate need of niceness since my daughter isn't nice. |
| `2017-06-30 05:48:25` | Unknown | Did you think it was suspicious? Did you think I wanted something?;) |
| `2017-06-30 05:49:28` | Jeffrey Epstein | Not yet |
| `2017-06-30 05:51:30` | Unknown | Contrary to what you and Woody think, I am a nice person.;) 0 |
| `2017-06-30 05:52:15` | Jeffrey Epstein | Glad to see you are having your period ----still |
| `2017-06-30 05:53:14` | Unknown | I am not. You sound like Donald Trump and that's not a good thing. |
| `2017-06-30 05:53:49` | Jeffrey Epstein | Agrreed |
| `2017-06-30 05:53:55` | Jeffrey Epstein | sorry |
| `2017-06-30 05:54:33` | Unknown | There's nothing to admire about Donald Trump. |
| `2017-06-30 05:55:12` | Jeffrey Epstein | Agreed that he is stupid |
| `2017-06-30 05:55:13` | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | The nerve of him accusing the woman of being in the low IQ club when he is the king of the low IQ club. |
| `2017-06-30 05:56:40` | Unknown | What president has time to tweet about things like this. He should have more important things on his plate and he shouldn't dignify himself with these stupid tweets. It should be beneath him but it's not. It's all very disappointing. |
| `2017-06-30 06:19:14` | Jeffrey Epstein | which three days will you be in cap entibbe\\ |
| `2017-06-30 09:55:34` | Jeffrey Epstein | Tell Woody Suki has a younger sister |
| `2017-06-30 10:06:06` | Unknown | It's just like you to be interested in the younger sister. At least you're consistent. I thought Mika Brzezinski come back of the picture of the Cheerios being for small hands against Donald Trump was good. |
| `2017-06-30 11:08:53` | Unknown | Did you just call me? |
