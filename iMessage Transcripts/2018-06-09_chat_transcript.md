| `2018-06-10 12:13:35` | Unknown | Dear Sebastian, Steve Bannon, who behind the scenes still is one of the most insightful and influential players in Washington ( and very close to the President), would like to see you on various issues. He is now working very closely with Victor Orban and other of your colleagues in Europe. I am having dinner with him in Paris on 22 June. He could come to Vienna any time between the 23 and 28 of that month. He is a very astute and extremely well informed analyst and player, though we have significantly different views on some issues ! I will strongly recommend that you see him, and am sure you will find it very useful. Warmest Terje |
