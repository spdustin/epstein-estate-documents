| `2019-03-18 08:23:24` | Unknown | The college scandal I bet will be gone by next week |
| `2019-03-18 08:24:16` | Jeffrey Epstein | no the college scandal will grow . everyone hates the rich. i have a new idea for you bd present |
| `2019-03-18 08:24:37` | Unknown | That'll be a good distraction then |
| `2019-03-18 08:24:42` | Unknown | What is the idea?? |
| `2019-03-18 08:26:20` | Jeffrey Epstein | you are receiving 30k in amex gift cards. or I think it much better thet you have your own credit card and start building a good credit history . so you can have money wired into your own account. and no one gets to review what you do with it. I prefer you have total privacy |
| `2019-03-18 09:11:55` | Unknown | I love both ideas .. I feel like it is difficult to set up my own credit card until I make my own money right ?? |
| `2019-03-18 09:27:50` | Jeffrey Epstein | no, its a very good idea to start now. the fact that you are in medical school will help. |
| `2019-03-18 09:28:41` | Unknown | Okay I like it! I do have my own account\_but I think it is debit not credit |
| `2019-03-18 09:28:44` | Unknown | Which is different right? |
| `2019-03-18 09:31:19` | Jeffrey Epstein | yes, you should apply for a visa CREDIT card |
| `2019-03-18 09:31:33` | Unknown | Okay sounds good. I will do that this week 0 0 and will let you know |
| `2019-03-18 09:32:00` | Jeffrey Epstein | its possible that they will need a balance so we will deposit money etc |
| `2019-03-18 09:32:15` | Unknown | Okay will let you know!!! |
