| `2019-06-14 13:45:35` | Jeffrey Epstein | in paris, weather great |
| `2019-06-15 06:35:48` | Unknown | I 11 call bit later. Would u continue to dictating op Ed's for peril? Think she was off w some guy falling in love w Buddhist art? Not sure who or what. |
| `2019-06-15 06:48:40` | Unknown | Drake equation probability estimation is garbage in garbage out but this not same thing as saying concept of a probability is wrong. Do I think meaningful to talk about prob of trump being re-elected or my getting horizontal w peril which are one shots. |
| `2019-06-15 06:54:47` | Jeffrey Epstein | Cannot use the concept of probability with only one example and not a repeated space . Gromov said its a question his children might ask and hopefully only once ! |
| `2019-06-15 06:56:21` | Jeffrey Epstein | Ill have red ink on my summer s dollar thank you. -It should be a ten as you did add - with gusto-jeffrey , that is REALLY stupid |
| `2019-06-15 06:57:46` | Unknown | Don't know Gromov. This is clearly wrong. Soviet doctrinaire sounds like. Do u think Question of prob that stock market will rise till end of 2019 is meaningless? You have one strong willed authority with achievements in some other sphere. So what. |
| `2019-06-15 06:58:41` | Unknown | U r better at understanding Chinese women than at probability theory. At understanding movement of money too. |
| `2019-06-15 07:07:53` | Jeffrey Epstein | The stock market models as a contiuous function. With a history and many past events . More like what is the probability you being reincarnated . |
| `2019-06-15 07:09:47` | Jeffrey Epstein | Im more concerned that it may be like the probability of you in bed again with peril. . 0 |
| `2019-06-15 07:21:46` | Unknown | Uh oh. Lhopital s rule |
| `2019-06-15 07:33:00` | Jeffrey Epstein | Not exactly getting within the limit is NOT the same as IN |
| `2019-06-15 07:34:41` | Unknown | Just called |
| `2019-06-15 07:47:07` | Jeffrey Epstein | Try now |
| `2019-06-15 08:26:49` | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | Just tried back |
| `2019-06-15 08:34:09` | Unknown | U called but I couldn't hear anything |
| `2019-06-15 12:44:21` | Jeffrey Epstein | https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/06/15/us/15reuters-new-jersey- airport.html?action=click&amp;module=Latest&amp;pgtype=Homepage |
| `2019-06-15 15:37:15` | Unknown | Got it |
| `2019-06-15 16:54:09` | Jeffrey Epstein | Subjective probability is a type of probability derived from an individual's personal judgment or own experience about whether a specific outcome is likely to occur. It contains no formal calculations and only reflects the subject's opinions and past experience rather than on data or computation. Subjective probabilities differ from person to person and contain a high degree of personal bias. |
| `2019-06-15 17:11:12` | Unknown | This is silly. |
| `2019-06-15 17:13:45` | Jeffrey Epstein | Exactly |
| `2019-06-16 07:45:26` | Unknown | Later. In meantime, strategy w peril? |
| `2019-06-16 07:46:46` | Jeffrey Epstein | Continue to dictate -little downside |
| `2019-06-16 07:48:19` | Jeffrey Epstein | Re later - you can read up on questions -re life on other planets described as " subjective probability " ie . Total nonsense |
| `2019-06-16 07:48:35` | Jeffrey Epstein | Red ink |
| `2019-06-16 07:51:37` | Unknown | Sounds like u r pessimistic re peril but agree. I think my injury is kind of exogenous event u said would change game. On other hand life has lots of bounces. |
| `2019-06-16 07:52:10` | Jeffrey Epstein | Not at all. Long game |
| `2019-06-16 07:53:30` | Jeffrey Epstein | Im rarely pessimistic, i wonder what the probability is? Or in this case as it is a binary decision appropriate to use " odds" |
| `2019-06-16 07:57:23` | Unknown | On subjective probability, I think life on other planets complex example. Is stock market one continuous event with much Or is this moment unique. If u grant meaningfulness if talking odds on one off events we are down to semantics. Where u say odds I say subjective probability. If u are rarely pessimistic does that discredit your optimism. Suppose instead of peril it was dunking a basketball or going to an island w Angela Jolie |
| `2019-06-16 08:04:21` | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | ? |
| `2019-06-16 08:06:22` | Jeffrey Epstein | Odds are limited to binary outcomes. . since you are immobile. Do some homework. . I concede your point on pessimism but would under bayesian rules. Feel comfortable. As humans are biased toward bad outcome avoidance. . She is never ever going to find another Larry summers. Probability ZERO |
| `2019-06-16 08:16:09` | Unknown | That can't be right. There are odds on dem nominee w many outcomes possible. For objective or subjective probability u need well defined events. |
| `2019-06-16 12:55:05` | Jeffrey Epstein | When are you able to walk again without crutches. Its wholly impolite for me to mentally attack a cripple |
| `2019-06-16 12:57:14` | Jeffrey Epstein | Handicapped , not cripple |
| `2019-06-16 13:15:31` | Unknown | 6 or 7 weeks. |
| `2019-06-16 13:16:45` | Jeffrey Epstein | On tues. I 11 have the math professor explain to you some things. And then wait until you are unable to claim your arguments were driven by the high level of pain killers. . on peril. Forced holding pattern in your interest |
| `2019-06-16 13:21:58` | Unknown | Why in my interest. Odds of success. I think another encounter at some point one third. Sustained series one fifth. Best shot for me. She gives up on marriage. Finds me invaluable and interesting and get her to conclude she can't have it without romance/sex without deciding I'm weak or vengeful |
| `2019-06-16 13:26:05` | Jeffrey Epstein | Over time. She is doomed to be with you |
| `2019-06-16 13:27:02` | Unknown | Unless she marries someone else. She is more monogamous than most |
| `2019-06-16 13:28:22` | Jeffrey Epstein | Painkillers? |
| `2019-06-16 13:47:00` | Unknown | Not for me?? |
| `2019-06-16 13:47:53` | Jeffrey Epstein | Your views formed by your meds? |
| `2019-06-16 21:01:18` | Unknown | Not formed by meds. Other than being a Bayesian rather than a pure math freak which wrong view do I have |
| `2019-06-17 02:21:14` | Jeffrey Epstein | She continues to be in contact |
| `2019-06-17 02:22:23` | Jeffrey Epstein | Things are good - davos is set for you / she is there because program person is chinese |
| `2019-06-17 02:22:35` | Jeffrey Epstein | Funny |
| `2019-06-17 05:33:18` | Unknown | Thx re davos. Happy to help re g20 |
| `2019-06-23 23:09:56` | Jeffrey Epstein | How are you |
| `2019-06-24 02:05:02` | Jeffrey Epstein | If Bernie were to cancel all student debt. . how Is that reflected on govt books/ ? |
| `2019-06-24 02:05:13` | Jeffrey Epstein | Do the borrowers get income? |
| `2019-06-24 02:20:43` | Unknown | I doubt borrowers get income but not certain. If they did many who struggle w debt service would get a whopping tax bill. I suspect a balance sheet impact but not a deficit impact. Depends on whether it's framed as a give away or recognition of reality. |
| `2019-06-24 03:34:39` | Jeffrey Epstein | How's the rehab. ? |
| `2019-06-24 03:36:24` | Jeffrey Epstein | My mathemactics guys. All said the propensity of the common man to put numbers on things where they don't belong is the answer to the odds probability questions et. |
| `2019-06-24 03:40:53` | Jeffrey Epstein | Send peril flowers |
| `2019-06-24 04:13:47` | Unknown | Your math guys are not that worldly. I 11 call u later |
| `2019-06-24 09:56:28` | Jeffrey Epstein | Ok |
| `2019-06-30 04:25:52` | Jeffrey Epstein | ?? U ok? |
| `2019-06-30 04:27:03` | Unknown | Yes. Sorry I will update you on developments. Will Ehud Be PM |
| `2019-06-30 04:28:53` | Jeffrey Epstein | 331 441 70210. Doubtful. But 1. He is not to be underestimated. 2. Unlikely top job. But depends on coalition. 3. Driving me crazy |
| `2019-06-30 09:27:53` | Jeffrey Epstein | ? |
| `2019-06-30 11:35:11` | Unknown | Tried back |

| `2019-07-05 10:47:02` | Jeffrey Epstein | Better than checov |
| `2019-07-05 10:47:40` | Unknown | Then I may misunderstand checov. |
| `2019-07-05 10:47:46` | Unknown | Or Ibsen |
| `2019-07-05 10:50:07` | Jeffrey Epstein | E. J. Dillon thought "the effect on the reader of Chekhov's tales was repulsion at the gallery of human waste represented by his fickle, spineless, drifting people" |
| `2019-07-05 10:54:34` | Jeffrey Epstein | "The Lady with the Dog"[91] (also translated from the Russian as "Lady with Lapdog"), [921 which depicts what at first seems a casual liaison between a cynical married man and a woman who meet while holidaying in Yalta. Neither expects anything lasting from the encounter. Unexpectedly though, they gradually fall deeply in love and end up risking scandal and the security of their family lives. The story masterfully captures their feelings for each other, the inner transformation undergone by the disillusioned male protagonist as a result of falling deeply in love, and their inability to resolve the matter by either letting go of their families or of each other.
