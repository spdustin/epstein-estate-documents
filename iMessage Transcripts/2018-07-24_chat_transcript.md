| `2018-07-26 02:14:41` | Jeffrey Epstein | Lets talk about strategy as November looks more problematic. . you don't want to spend all your time in front of committee after committee . |

| `2018-07-27 04:09:15` | Unknown | I cancelled my Hannity hit tonight |
| `2018-07-27 04:09:34` | Unknown | Have u seen the FT this morning |
| `2018-07-27 04:13:37` | Jeffrey Epstein | Yes. Ganesh writes well, don jr , perjury. Congress . Matt calamari soon up to bat. . trump still carrying on re you and Roy Moore. . |
| `2018-07-27 04:16:29` | Jeffrey Epstein | I thought that Ganesh got the last paragraph really right. And that contrasts with dharma ending . The current ending implies the end of relevance. After destruction , almost walking toward the sunset. As opposed to standing there as the sun RISES |
| `2018-07-27 04:21:48` | Jeffrey Epstein | I think you want to project WINNING. As contrasted with always destroying. . there was little winning in the film. McNamara was portrayed as out of touch. Id like you to be portrayed as the exact opposite. Really in touch. |
| `2018-07-27 04:22:33` | Unknown | I'm talking about TODAYs FT? |

| `2018-07-27 11:43:55` | Jeffrey Epstein | George son will take over. Soon. |
| `2018-07-27 11:45:01` | Jeffrey Epstein | the key is to get him to focus more on the arts. |
| `2018-07-27 11:45:53` | Unknown | George son a goofball-- I want a piece of george |
| `2018-07-27 11:46:31` | Jeffrey Epstein | Thats a good thing. . that should be easy as he is falling apart |
| `2018-07-27 11:46:54` | Unknown | Yes-- need to be the one that takes him down |
| `2018-07-27 11:47:03` | Jeffrey Epstein | No shit sherlock |
| `2018-07-27 11:51:21` | Jeffrey Epstein | Theres an argument to be made that it takes you out of the blast radius ,. asked today , how many people around Donald can have a heart attack the same week and not look suspicious |
| `2018-07-27 11:52:36` | Jeffrey Epstein | Maybe its like those cruise ship diseases. Or a new form of legionaire disease where the entire staff is incapacitated. Like on those cheap cruises |
| `2018-07-27 11:56:12` | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | LOL |
| `2018-07-28 02:31:03` | Jeffrey Epstein | Great idea to do Hannity every week. attention. . very clever. . FT article got wide |
| `2018-07-28 02:38:51` | Jeffrey Epstein | kurtz read the article Cohen weisselburg pecker did not |
| `2018-07-28 02:47:15` | Unknown | U think doing fox weekly smart??? |
| `2018-07-28 03:01:37` | Jeffrey Epstein | Yes but.. Europe needs to feel love . Not sure how you balance |
| `2018-07-28 03:25:26` | Jeffrey Epstein | Also with so much shit about to come out , your credibility must be paramount |
| `2018-07-28 03:30:15` | Unknown | I balance by getting there on the ground |
| `2018-07-28 03:33:42` | Jeffrey Epstein | Agreed, do you do some Hannity from Europe, or back and forth |
| `2018-07-28 04:05:32` | Unknown | I can do Hannity from Europe |
| `2018-07-28 05:11:15` | Jeffrey Epstein | Its not what I understand. I might wonder if it is possible to do two ground games simultaneously . Telling some to ring doorbells and get out the vote while you are in Europe should be carefully considered. |
| `2018-07-28 05:57:50` | Jeffrey Epstein | Note, I spoke with the president of Ethiopia and Eritrea , they have agreed not to do any more work with the Chinese. ! as they now understand the trick. In fact there is a possiblitiy of the two countries becoming one. |
| `2018-07-28 05:58:24` | Jeffrey Epstein | Even better than high tariffs |

| `2018-07-28 06:02:51` | Unknown | Agree |
| `2018-07-28 06:04:56` | Jeffrey Epstein | Whether it be Donald , Cohen pecker they play by the rules of the 80s. As you said the land that time forgot. - don jr was advised to take five in front of the senate , daddy said no. |
