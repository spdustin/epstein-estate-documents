# Epstein Estate Documents

Up-to-date as of 2025-11-12 "Seventh Production"

This archive has been post-processed for easier use by researchers, journalists, and other interested parties. Additional LLM-specific processing is on the way to support folks using LLMs to "chat with" the corpus.

Current differences between this release and the official US House of Representatives release:

- Opticon and Concordance databases have been rolled up to [HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_009_REPORT.csv](HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_009_REPORT.csv), collapsing multi-page documents into a single row. Note: "official" Concordance index did NOT include all metadata fields, like e-mail addresses
- All multi-page documents, in both their image and (poorly) OCR'd text forms, have been collapsed down to single files for each (see the [Merged Documents](/Merged%20Documents/) directory)
- Text files that came from iMessage have been transformed to a more readable format (see the [iMessage Transcripts](/iMessage%20Transcripts) directory)
