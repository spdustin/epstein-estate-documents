With the re-election of President Obama, this is likely to continue.\n\nShare on twitterShare on linkedinShare on facebookShare on email\n\n[IMAGE]Bigstock image[/IMAGE]\n\nWhen US President Barack Obama came into office he made good on his promise to overturn President George W. Bush's executive order that - with the exception of a handful of existing stem cell lines - prohibited federal funding of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research.\n\nSpecial Report - Stem Cell Research under Horizon 2020\nStem Cell Research in Horizon 2020: Experts debate what Europe must do to maintain its lead in regenerative medicine\nThe view from the US: Stem cell therapy steps up a gear with first approval and improved political climate\nView from Europe: Delivering on the vision of regenerative medicine and stem cells\nBenedetto de Alwis: Leading the global charge towards clinical applications for cell therapy research in Horizon 2020\nOVERVIEW: Regenerate the future - human embryonic stem cell research is crucial to deliver health and growth\n\nThis easing of restrictions on hESC research was expected to engender enough confidence to attract investors into the space and encourage pharmaceutical and biotech companies to build robust product pipelines based on stem cell therapies. However, a tougher regulatory climate for biopharmaceuticals in general and a protracted legal challenge to the relaxing of rules on hESCs has served to keep both big pharma companies and venture capitalists on the sidelines to date.\n\nNevertheless, there are some positive signals. Obama has now secured a second mandate. There and a half years on, stem cells are no longer high on the political agenda as they once were. This speaks to the generally positive public acceptance of stem cell research in the US. A ResearchAmerica poll of likely voters in the presidential election, conducted in August 2012, found that 61 per cent of prospective voters were in favor of expanding funding for hESC research.\n\nInvestor interest\nThis positive public mood is borne out in some major gains. These include funding increases for the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) stem cell initiatives, and greater investor interest in the wider field of regenerative medicine including the use of adult stem cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells.\n\nHowever, it was only in August 2012 that a protracted lawsuit, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave the green light for the Californian biotech Geron to begin the very first human clinical trial of a human embryonic stem cell-derived therapy for patients with a spinal cord injury.\n\nThe Phase I trial, treating patients with acute spinal cord injury, was hit with an FDA clinical hold causing significant delays to its initiation in 2010. A year later, after 15 years effort, the Geron medical device trial was cleared. Running withdrawal from the sector to concentrate on its cancer therapeutics unit, but this trial served as an early leading player in hESC translation and commercialization. However, the regenerative medicine sector has been able to recover and is beginning to thrive. Now Pfizer-founded and Pluristem are attempting to revive the trials and are now attempting to revive it.\n\nResearch funding robust\nFederal funding for all forms of stem cell research has increased over the past four years. However, the NIH funding component for hESC research has been frozen since its past three years. In Sherley v. Sebelius, researchers James Sherley and Theresa Deisher - who worked with adult stem cells, claimed the NIH guidelines violated the Dickey-Wicker Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds for research in which human embryos are destroyed or discarded. This overhang was not finally removed until August 2012 when a three-judge panel from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld the NIH 2009 guidelines that permit funding of hESC research.\n\nThrough its Common Fund the NIH has established the Center for Regenerative Medicine (NIH CRM), to support this field, with the goal of accelerating the translation of stem cell-based clinical therapies.\n\nState funding filling the void\nWith stem cell research in general not attracting a significant amount of venture funding, the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), which was established in 2004 with $3 billion for stem cell research at California universities and research institutions, has begun to fill the void left by traditional venture capital firms. To date CIRM has allocated $150 million in funding to help prove the concept of stem cell research through basic biology work.\n\n\"We are a lot closer to having promising therapies ready for clinical trials, so it makes sense that we step up our engagement with industry to help find those trials and move those therapies closer to approval by the FDA,\" said Dianne Rush, the governing Board of CIRM.\n\nCIRM's funding for translational research is good news for biotech companies, providing them with a source of funds in a field where it has been difficult to raise private finance.\n\nThree biotech companies have been funded so far under CIRM's Strategic Partnership Awards initiative. A grant of $10.1 million was awarded to ViaVyte, Inc. to continue preclinical research and initiate clinical testing of an embryonic stem cell-based therapy for patients with type 1 diabetes. The partnership includes a funding provision for an investigator-initiated Phase II clinical trial, to evaluate the potential of this therapy. Meanwhile, Bluebird Bio Inc. will use a $9.3 million grant to support a Phase I/II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LentiGlobin, the company's programme for the treatment of the inherited blood disorder beta-thalassemia, which will be initiated in the US in 2013. StemCells Inc. has been awarded up to $20 million to fund preclinical development of its product consisting of purified human neural stem cells for treating Alzheimer's disease, with the goal of filing for permission to carry out a clinical trial in that time. In July, CIRM awarded a $16 million grant to the company for up to $20 million to fund preclinical development of a cell therapy for spinal cord injury.\n\nPublic Markets\nThere have also be breakthroughs in the public markets, with the thirteen publicly-listed stem cell companies showing an average increase in share price of 11.6 percent in the year-to-date.\n\nThis positive upturn in the stem cell sector's fortunes recalls triumphs. It was a big breakthrough for the field as a whole when children with age-related macular degeneration were successfully treated with stem cell Therapeutics' in allocentric stem cell Therapy for a blinding eye disease (GvHD) in children.\n\nThis despite being the world's first regulatory approval of a manufactured stem cell product and the first therapy approved for GvHD - a devastating complication of bone marrow transplantation that kills up to 80 percent of children affected, many within just weeks of the procedure. The company's stock value has almost doubled in the course of this year.\n\nProdus, Canada's first stem cell therapy company, recently received regulatory approval from Health Canada. In addition to its CIRM grant, the company recently reported clinical and preclinical data demonstrating the therapeutic potential of a cell therapy for treating myocardial disease.\n\nAnother positive milestone was announced in June 2012, when clinical trial results - albeit on a small scale - showed some of our years on, three patients, a single whose age-related bone marrow who received an intramuscular injection of its PLacental eXpanded (PLX) cells under compassionate use saw an improved ejection, compared to placebo, after successfully complete a public offering which raised about US$30 million.\n\nPositive clinical trials will begin to encourage investment\nWhile still a long early stages of development - and with almost trials having only involved a limited number of patients - reports to date have been very promising, and provide further validation for encouraging investment in stem cell therapeutics. For example, data from a human embryonic stem cell trial conducted by Advanced Cell Technology and published in medical journal The Lancet, showed that two patients with Stargardt's disease, a degenerative eye condition, had regained some vision.\n\nIn addition, positive early data from a spinal cord injury trial involving StemCells Inc. in a cell population indicated that two patients with no neurological function below the neck, The scientific progress has helped the early stage of optimism into the US stem cell sector. The Fiscal Cliff apart, it seems likely this momentum will continue now Obama has secured a second term.\n\nPeter Winter is a writer, editor and analyst on the global biotechnology industry.
