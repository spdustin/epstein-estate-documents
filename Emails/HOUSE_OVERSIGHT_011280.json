Bottom line: North American investors are very bullish the banks (long only AND hedge funds AND macro funds), but they conclude \"I don't own enough\". Note that high touch flows have slowed down significantly since Thanksgiving and where the bunches have been concentrated in XLF (every client sector we have has been a better buyer of XLF).\n\n**Client focus:**\n1) Regulation: Excitement, with the base case that it's not getting worse.\n2) Sentiment on rates: Cautiously bullish\n3) Sentiment on growth: Also bullish\n4) Sentiment on corporate tax rate cuts: buyside more bullish than sellside. In 1986, bank stocks exploded upward (outperforming the S&P) after Reagan's tax reform bill passed the Senate; and 2) in 2003, the last time we saw personal tax cuts, loan growth industry wide accelerated in 2003 and 2004.\n\n• **Biggest Pushback on owning sector at current levels:** Too far too fast: BKX +18.00% post election: Valuation coming into question and Q4 has typically been a seasonally weak qtr. Bulls defend valuation on \"18bsts with potential upside to 2018 EPS from ~25-40% and stocks still cheap vs. discretionary.\n\n• Price action and sentiment keeps us constructive, we like the long and would expect US financials to benefit from any beta chase into year end.\n\n• **How to play it?** We still like \"appearing\" call spreads on XLF\n  ○ Buy a 6 month 105% call with a short 110% call that knock in if XLF trades above 115% during the life of the trade for 1.75% premium cost\n  • Gross max payoff if knock-in is triggered: 2.8x (5.0%/1.75%)\n  • Gross max payoff if knock-in is not triggered: 5.6x (9.9%/1.75%) – you have upside up to 114.9%\n\n**Post Election Flow Skews - Buyers of Health Care (via ETFs) and Financials (mainly ETFs)**\n\n• **US Buyback Flows**\n• Cons Disc, Technology and Financials are the largest 3 sectors for US buybacks (over 70% of execution). We are seeing a seasonal increase in buybacks as we come out of the low seasonal month of the year (October) and should see increased buyback executions until year-end; another source of upside for the Cons Disc, Technology and Financials sectors.\n\n**Global Positioning,** Nigel Tupper, 11/14. Large long-only funds are more underweight Financials than any other sector and are UW this sector in all regions.\n\n**Future of Financials** conference hosted 90 public and private companies at our Future of Financials conference. We are raising our price objectives across most of our names. Three primary reasons why we think there is upside remaining"
