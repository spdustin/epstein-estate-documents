We see USDJPY reaching 120 next year and Japanese reflation, bullish for Japanese equities, particularly the banks.\n- Huge focus on Banks/Financials post Trump election; they are the big winners.\n- The banking sector is the main beneficiary of higher rates and less regulation overhang.\n- Investors are still underweight Japan, especially in financials, so the move can have legs.\n- Valuation is still at depressed levels. Japanese banks are cheap versus their peers.\n- Uncertainty remains, so buying calls and call spreads makes sense. Instead of building a large cash position, we believe options are a better play in case the market reverses and initiates a risk-off move again.\n- BAML expects USDJPY 115-120 by end of 2017 with NKY targeting 20,000 (12% upside).\n- BOJ refraining from further flattening of the local yield curve is positive for banks and insurers.\n- DXJ carries a 12% weight in banks whereas NKY is only 1.07% and TPX is 8.55%.\n- Positioning is light: DXJ shares outstanding are at three-year lows as foreigners have sold roughly $52bln of Japanese equities year-to-date.\n- DXJ skew remains flat; 2m 25d put/call skew sits at the 19th percentile over the past year.\n\nJapan Investment Strategy, Japan Econ Outlook and Japan Macro Watch attached.\n\nDXJ 2m 25d Put/Call over the past year.\n[IMAGE]\n(line chart titled \"DXJ 2m 25d Put/Call over the past year\" covering Dec 2015 through Nov 2016, showing the ratio fluctuating from roughly 1.10 to 1.40 and currently near 1.40.)\n[/IMAGE]"
