      "message_content": "Our Financials Conference was this week and client attendance was up by 66% from last year. Yes, banks/financials might pull back at some point after this run-up but we would be buyers on any pullbacks and we continue to see further upside from multiple expansion and earnings growth. Our analyst raised her price targets by ~11% across the board. The long term rotation from bonds and div stocks into sectors like financials is only beginning.\n\nVol is higher on the week; what prices well now:\nBuy the XLF March 2017 $22 call with $26 Knock-Out (continuous) for $0.87, with a full premium rebate if knock-out occurs.\nThis prices well today given that call skew and if XLF breaches $26 and this knocks out, at least you get your premium back.\n\nPlease find our Financials report attached.\n\nFuture of Financials conference hosted public and private companies at our Future of Financials conference. We are raising our price objectives across most of our names. Three primary reasons why we think there is upside remaining after the recent rally: 1) an improving economic outlook; 2) higher activity levels and interest rates (Erika flagging; and 3) relatively tighter positioning in US financials vs. other sectors .

Funds are underweight financials in all regions, valuations are reasonable, earnings are improving and financials tend to outperform when bond yields rise.\n\nVol is higher today – refreshed pricing below.\n\nBuy an XLF 17March2017 call spread:\n• Buy the 105% call / sell a 110% call with a 115% at-expiry knock-in\n• Total premium: 1.86%\n\nGlobal Positioning in Stocks: Nigel Tupper notes the 4000 funds in our \"Positioning in Stocks\" analysis are more underweight Financials, on average, than any other sector and are underweight this sector in all regions of the world. Nigel continues to improve and yield tilts, which is often the case in an upturn in our Global Wave, then the unloved Financials sector has the potential to continue to outperform.\n\nGlobal Quant Panorama: \"Borrow on Bonds\" stocks (which tend to move in the opposite direction to bond yields) tend to outperform our \"Bullish On Bonds\" when bond yields rise. The sectors that tend to perform best as bond yields rise are Energy, Tech, Materials, Banks, and Diversified Financials. Of these sectors, the laggards this year have been Banks and Diversified Financials. With a PE of 15.9x and a PB of 2.0x, Global valuations are reasonable. Also, Risk is near all-time lows in terms of PE in most regions. Now that macro and earnings data have triggered the beginning of a rotation, Value becomes very relevant."

                  "message_content": "It's not too late to buy financials as a medium term trade. They've run up a lot this week but we're getting endless calls from generalists asking which banks to buy – there is still more upside to the sector. Banks also provide some offset to your bonds if markets continue to move. Our Financials sector strategist Erika Najarian thinks XLF could have another 20-25% upside given its many levers to the Trump trade: less regulation, higher interest rates/steeper yield curve, higher cap growth, etc. The regional banks are even more of a pure play on a rates move but we view the larger cap banks as having even more upside to the Trump Trade given the above points.\n\nBuy an XLF March 2017 110% call spread:\n• Buy the 105% call / sell a 110% call with a 115% at-expiry knock-in\n• Total premium: 1.75%\n\nAll eyes are on Sunday's 60 Minutes interview with Trump. Market is pricing that all regulations will be rolled back (very optimistic). Any hint that Trump is more moderate on policy, banks will retrace some gains.\n\nNote on tech: we're seeing FANG used as a source of funds with the rotation from growth into value. There's also the tax read-through: tech is already relatively tax advantaged @ 22%; Industrials are at 30%, Financials at 29%. Next year, tech could benefit from repatriation tax holiday plus tax as viewed as more of a QOL trade.\n\nMore thoughts on financials:\nWith respect to the economy, the market is certainly indicating that there will be a large fiscal stimulus which may assist US growth potentially looking for financials to see a wide range of reasons, from lower unemployment to wages to loan growth and credit quality (even if somewhat offset by higher rates). It does remain to be seen exactly how much of this expected policy actually gets passed, but at the moment, investors are willing to take a certain amount of growth on faith.\n\nSo those are positives for financials before we even discuss regulation. The move in the financials since the election would certainly seem to indicated that investors have concluded that nearly every piece of financial regulation will get put into a shredder on day one of the new administration. The incoming administration has hinted that with comments about rolling back pieces (or more) of Dodd-Frank in particular. I can see making the case for that to the American public by saying that banks need less regulation in order to get more capital flowing into the economy to drive growth. Not only that but saying that higher E is likely too low (meaning that the P/E is not as high as it seems) but it could help improve ROE's as well which could increase the multiple of that higher E investors are willing to pay. Note that while ROEs could go higher, we should note that they can get back to the peaks...\n\nRegards,\nAmanda\n\nAmanda Ens\nDirector\nBank of America Merrill Lynch\nMerrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated\nOne Bryant Park, 5th Floor, New York, NY 10036\n[REDACTED]\n\nThe power of global connections™\n\n[IMAGE]Bank of America Merrill Lynch logo[/IMAGE]"
