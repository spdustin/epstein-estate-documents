As of today, there are eight (8) of these aircraft that are not yet on the market.\n\nLet me know if you would like to speak with him and by what means (you call him, he call you, call Larry?....whatever).\n\nBy the way, his company sold Trump's 727 and got Trump a very attractive number for an aircraft that was on its way to a museum.\n\nHope all is well."
